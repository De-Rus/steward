# Fields & widgets

A `field "column" { }` block controls how one column is rendered and edited. Only
the columns you want to customize need a block; the rest use introspected
defaults.

```hcl
field "price" {
  label  = "Unit price"
  widget = "money"
  params = { currency = "USD" }
  format = "currency"
  prefix = "$"
  color  = "sign"
}
```

## Field options

| Key | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `label` | string | Override the column header / detail label. |
| `widget` | string | The renderer — a built-in name or `custom:<name>`. See the [widget library](#widget-library). |
| `readonly` | bool | Field is shown but not editable (per-field variant of `edit.readonly`). |
| `masked` | bool | Value is masked in lists, detail, search and export. See [Security](/security#column-masking). |
| `sql` | string | A trusted SQL expression that makes this a **computed, read-only column** (see below). |
| `group` | string | Detail-form section this field belongs to (an alternative to `detail { section { } }`). |
| `params` | map | Widget-specific parameters (see each widget). |
| `image` | block | Marks the field as an uploadable image (see [`image { }`](#image-uploads)). |
| `format` | string | A number/date formatter applied to the value. |
| `prefix` / `suffix` | string | Text prepended / appended to the displayed value. |
| `truncate` | number | Truncate the displayed string to N characters. |
| `display` | string | A `{column}` template that replaces the displayed text. |
| `href` | string | A `{column}` template turning the value into a link target. |
| `color` | string / block | Conditional coloring — a named strategy or a rule set (see [Conditional color](#conditional-color)). |

## Computed columns (`sql`)

A field with a `sql` expression is a **virtual, read-only column** that doesn't
exist in the table. steward selects it as `(<sql>) AS "<name>"`. The current row
is aliased `t`, so you can aggregate related tables:

```hcl
field "signals_24h" {
  label  = "Signals 24h"
  widget = "number"
  sql    = "(SELECT count(*) FROM markets.bot_signals s WHERE s.bot_id = t.id AND s.created_at > now() - interval '24 hours')::int"
}

field "age_days" {
  label  = "Age (days)"
  widget = "number"
  sql    = "extract(day from now() - t.created_at)::int"
}
```

The expression is trusted config, not user input, and is read-only.

By default a computed column is display-only. Make it **sortable** — like Django's
`@admin.display(ordering=…)`:

```hcl
field "pe_ratio" {
  label    = "P/E"
  sql      = "t.price / nullif(t.eps_diluted, 0)"
  sortable = true                 # list sort orders BY the expression
}

field "signals_24h" {
  label   = "Signals 24h"
  sql     = "(SELECT count(*) FROM markets.bot_signals s WHERE s.bot_id = t.id)::int"
  sort_by = "last_eval_at"        # …or sort by another real column instead
}
```

| Key | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `sortable` | Order the list by the `sql` expression when this column's header is used. |
| `sort_by` | Order by another **real** column instead of the expression. |

A `sort_by` that names a column a role has **masked** is refused for that role (so
ordering can't leak a hidden value). An `sql` expression that references a masked
column can still order by it — keep masked columns out of `sortable` expressions.

## Formatting

`format` runs the value through a formatter. The vocabulary is fixed:

| `format` | Renders |
| --- | --- |
| `currency` | Localized currency. |
| `percent` | Percentage. |
| `number` | Grouped number with separators. |
| `date` | Date only. |
| `datetime` | Date and time. |
| `bytes` | Human byte size (`1.4 MB`). |
| `duration` | Human duration from seconds. |

`prefix`, `suffix` and `truncate` are independent string tweaks you can combine
with any widget:

```hcl
field "win_rate" {
  format   = "percent"
  suffix   = "%"
  truncate = 40
}
```

## Interpolation: `display` and `href`

Both take a template with `{column}` placeholders filled from the row:

```hcl
field "name" {
  display = "{first_name} {last_name}"
  href    = "https://crm.example/u/{id}"
}
```

`display` replaces the shown text; `href` makes the cell a link. (For an
explicit link widget with a new-tab option, see [`link` / `url`](#links-email-phone-url).)

## Conditional color

`color` tints a value based on its content. Two forms.

### Named strategies

```hcl
field "pnl" {
  format = "currency"
  color  = "sign"
}
```

| Strategy | Effect |
| --- | --- |
| `sign` | Positive green, negative red. |
| `positive` | Highlight positive values. |
| `negative` | Highlight negative values. |
| `stale` | Highlight stale / old values. |

### Rule sets

For explicit thresholds, use `color { rule "…" { class = "…" } }`. Rules are
evaluated in order; the first match wins.

```hcl
field "score" {
  color {
    rule ">0"          { class = "good" }
    rule "<0"          { class = "critical" }
    rule "between:1,2" { class = "warning" }
    rule "=n/a"        { class = "muted" }
  }
}
```

**Rule conditions** (`when`):

| Form | Matches |
| --- | --- |
| `>N`, `>=N`, `<N`, `<=N` | Numeric comparison. |
| `between:LO,HI` | Numeric range. |
| `=text` | Exact string equality. |

**Rule classes** (`class`) must be one of: `good`, `warning`, `critical`,
`neutral`, `accent`, `muted`. Any other class or an unparseable condition is a
load error.

## Image uploads

An `image { }` block turns a column into an uploadable, on-disk-resized image:

```hcl
field "logo" {
  image {
    dir       = "logos"        # subdirectory under the config bundle
    name_col  = "symbol"       # column supplying the stored filename
    max_px    = 256            # longest edge, default 256
    normalize = true           # re-encode/normalize on upload, default true
  }
}
```

Uploaded images are served back through steward's static asset route.

## Widget library

Set `widget = "<name>"`. Widgets that take parameters read them from the field's
`params` map. Unlisted `params` keys are ignored.

### Text & structured

| Widget | Renders | Notable `params` |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `text` | Plain text (the default). | — |
| `textarea` | Multi-line text; wraps in detail, truncates in lists. | — |
| `code` | Monospace code block; syntax-aware in detail. | `lang` (e.g. `python`, `sql`) |
| `json` | Pretty JSON tree in detail, compact preview in lists. | — |
| `masked` | Renders the (already-masked) value in monospace. | — |
| `truncate` | Truncates to N chars with a full-value tooltip. | `chars` (default 40) |
| `copyable` | Value with a click-to-copy affordance. | — |
| `uuid` | Shortened UUID with click-to-copy. | — |

### Numbers

| Widget | Renders | Notable `params` |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `number` | Right-aligned, grouped number. | — |
| `money` | Currency-formatted amount. | `currency` (e.g. `USD`) |
| `percent` | Percentage (negatives tinted in lists). | — |
| `duration` | Human duration from a seconds value. | — |
| `bytes` | Human byte size. | — |
| `progress` | A horizontal progress bar + percent. | `max` (default 100), `warn_at`, `color` |
| `rating` | A row of icons (e.g. stars). | `max` (default 5), `icon` (default `★`) |
| `trend` | Signed value with ▲/▼ arrow, colored by sign. | — |
| `heatcell` | A cell tinted by magnitude within a range. | `min` (default 0), `max` (default 100) |

### Booleans & enums

| Widget | Renders | Notable `params` |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `toggle` | A check / dash for truthy / falsy. | — |
| `badge` | A colored badge from a value → color map. | `colors` |
| `pill` | Same as `badge` (pill styling). | `colors` |
| `tags` | Splits a list/CSV value into multiple badges. | `colors` |

The `colors` param maps values to one of `blue`, `green`, `orange`, `red`,
`violet`, `gray`:

```hcl
field "status" {
  widget = "badge"
  params = { colors = { running = "green", halted = "red", idle = "gray" } }
}
```

### Time

| Widget | Renders | Notable `params` |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `datetime` | Localized date + time. | — |
| `relative_time` | "3 minutes ago", tinted when stale. | `warn_after` (seconds; older values warn) |

```hcl
field "last_eval_at" {
  widget = "relative_time"
  params = { warn_after = 900 }
}
```

### Links, email, phone, URL

| Widget | Renders | Notable `params` |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `link` / `url` | A hyperlink; target from `href` or `params.href`. | `href` (template), `new_tab` (bool) |
| `email` | A `mailto:` link. | — |
| `phone` | A `tel:` link. | — |

```hcl
field "homepage" {
  widget = "url"
  params = { href = "{homepage}", new_tab = true }
}
```

### Media & identity

| Widget | Renders | Notable `params` |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `image` | An inline image from a URL/data-URL value. | — |
| `avatar` | A small (optionally round) avatar image. | `size` (12–96, default 24), `rounded` (default true) |
| `color` | A swatch + the color string. | — |
| `country` / `flag` | A flag emoji + the country code. | — |

### Relations & arrays

| Widget | Renders | Notable `params` |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `fk` | A link to the referenced record, using its label. | — |
| `array` | Each array element as a small chip. | — |

Foreign-key columns are detected during introspection and render as links
automatically; the `fk` widget is the explicit form.

## Custom widgets

Any widget name of the form `custom:<name>` loads a web component you ship in the
config bundle at `config/widgets/<name>.js`. It receives the full row and the
field's `params`. Unknown custom widgets fall back to the raw value — never a
crash.

```hcl
field "equity" {
  widget = "custom:sparkline"       # → /static/config/widgets/sparkline.js
  params = { field = "equity_curve", color = "blue" }
}
```

The three bundled custom widgets — `sparkline`, `statuspill`, `minibar` — and how
to author your own are covered in
[Pages & queries](/configuration/pages-and-queries#custom-widgets).
